This is the simplest way I could think of to run RSpec from Vim.

Just call CopyRSpecFileCommand() or CopyRSpecSingleExampleCommand(), and the
command will be copied to your clipboard, ready to be pasted into a terminal.

These are the mappings I use (in ~/.vimrc):

  let mapleader = ","
  nnoremap <Leader>r :call CopyRSpecFileCommand()<CR>
  nnoremap <Leader>R :call CopyRSpecSingleExampleCommand()<CR>
